# UFOs


## Overview:

We are helping Dana take a Javascript file filled with sighting information and turning it into a table with filters. Additionally, we will pushing all of that data to an HTML page including the article, the table of data, and usable filters to get the results you are looking for.

## Results:

•	In our first clickable filter, we are able to get an exact date to type in. This will output all the articles from that specific date into our HTML page.


•	The 2nd , 3rd , and 4th filters moving down give you the locations of the recorded incidents. You can filter through Country, State, and City for this one. 


•	The last filter is the shape of the UFO. This enables us to narrow down our search by shape.

## Summary:

The HTML page works great, however, I think it could use a couple improvements. The location filters I think could be all lumped in to 1 filter, making for an easy way for users to interface with the HTML page. 

Another way of maybe improving the development of the HTML would be to acquire the weather from the date of each incident for further speculative analysis. This way, we might be able to rule some of the questionable incidents from“UFO” contention to special weather conditions causing a false sighting.
